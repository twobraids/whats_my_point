This project is an intellectual exercise, not a serious project for production use. Maybe it will inspire someone to make a more serious version that accomplishes the same thing with more more aplomb and efficiency. This implementation is likely full of problems, can't-get-there-from-here situations, or other such troubles. There is no warranty, no guarantee, and the author is absentee.
